Predicting the stock prices of Cryptocurrencies using Causal Analysis


This project predicts and analyzes the cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano) and to find the cause and effect (Causality) between Google Trends and these cryptocurrencies. We built a model that predicts the percentage change in each of the cryptocurrencies, with the help of ARIMA, while also considering the factors that affect their values. 

We also used XGBoost which is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient.
